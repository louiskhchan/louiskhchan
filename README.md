# Hi

I am currently looking for Flutter developer jobs (remote or near Toronto). I recently published a flutter app on the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojart/id1632243774) and the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navonapps.emojart). I found [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) a great framework to work with and would like to start a career with it. 

I was a university lecturer who taught cognitive psychology for 10+ years. While my primary duties might be conducting research and teaching classes, I often coded. The codes and demos below showcase my programming skills, which greatly facilitated my research and teaching duties.
