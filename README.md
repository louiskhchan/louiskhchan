# Hi

I am currently working at CMiC as a software engineer. As a personal project, I authored an app on the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emojart/id1632243774) and the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navonapps.emojart). I found [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) a great framework to work with. 

I was a university lecturer who taught cognitive psychology for 10+ years. I really liked lecturing and supervising students. I liked doing research. I didn't like writing papers and marking assignments. I like to code as well, which sometimes facilitated my teaching and research.
